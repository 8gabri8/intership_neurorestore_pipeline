> **Note:** For specific steps performed in `measurements_slices_xls.groovy`, please check the script documentation.

## Merging all .tsv files in one csv for one Brain
The previous step creates one .tsv file for each slice/brain image of the project. 
Run the script [create_csv_whole_brain.py](create_csv_whole_brain.py) for merging all these .tsv files in one single csv file.

>**Note**: the script is meant to run on multiple brains at the same time, pay attention to give as input the root folder of the whole project and to respect the structure of the filesystem expted by the script.
