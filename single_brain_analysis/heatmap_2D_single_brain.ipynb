    "This notebook, given the folder of the porject, returns a series of 2D Heatmpas made with BrainRender.\n",
    "The values relative to the 2 hemipshere are differnt, and correspond to the .\n",
    "**Attention**: the way in which the final image is created with the 2 hemispheres is the following. 2 Imges of differt hmeipsjere are creted, they are spliced in half and then they are merged. Due to this project the usur shoudl pay attention where to cut the 2 images (i.e. doing half is not always a good chooise). Later ij  the bootebbk the user can adjust this settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook follows the following steps:\n",
    "- aks the user the mandaotry inputs and paramters for the notebook\n",
    "- creates a series fo function useful for later, namely\n",
    "    - `split_and_merge_png_images()` given 2 images, saves a new one that is the merge of the 2 halves of the oringla images \n",
    "    - `find_measurement_dirs` given the main dir, reutnr a lsit with all the _Measurment dirs (one for each brain)\n",
    "- find the csv file for each brains that contians the sanpese diensity for each roi\n",
    "- create the heatmap images. It is done in differt steps:\n",
    "    - read the relative csv file\n",
    "    - create folder for the results of the current brain\n",
    "    - create left heatmaps\n",
    "    - create right heatmaps\n",
    "    - merge them\n",
    "- create a video\n",
    "\n",

    "**Attention**: The notebook shoudl be run in a Kernel created with the file [brainrender-env.yml](assets/yml/brainrender-env.yml)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Attention**: To correctly execute the notebook, you must create a new function `my_plot()` in the `heatmap.py` script. This file is located in the `brainrender-env/lib/python3.9/site-packages/brainglobe_heatmap` directory of your virtual environment. The file []() contains the fucntion that you can paste.\n",
